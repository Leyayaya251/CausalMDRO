# CausalMDRO
This repository offers a comprehensive framework for predicting multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) using various causal discovery and machine learning models, including FCI, DAG-GNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and RNN-based time series models such as LSTM and GRU. All models are implemented using data extracted from the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV databases.

## Setup
1.Obtain access to the MIMIC-IV and MIMIC-III dataset by following the steps: https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/gettingstarted/  
2.After receiving credentials, download the necessary files from the: https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/3.1/
