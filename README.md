# CausalMDRO
This repository offers a comprehensive framework for predicting multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) using various causal discovery and machine learning models, including FCI, DAG-GNN, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and RNN-based time series models such as LSTM and GRU. All models are implemented using data extracted from the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV databases.
